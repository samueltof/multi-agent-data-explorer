# # Hierarchical Agent Teams
# 
# In our previous example ([Agent Supervisor](../agent_supervisor)), we introduced the concept of a single [supervisor node](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/#supervisor) to route work between different worker nodes.
# 
# But what if the job for a single worker becomes too complex? What if the number of workers becomes too large?
# 
# For some applications, the system may be more effective if work is distributed _hierarchically_.
# 
# You can do this by composing different subgraphs and creating a top-level supervisor, along with mid-level supervisors.
# 
# To do this, let's build a simple research assistant! The graph will look something like the following:
# 
# ![diagram](attachment:d98ed25c-51cb-441f-a6f4-016921d59fc3.png)
# 
# This notebook is inspired by the paper [AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155), by Wu, et. al. In the rest of this notebook, you will:
# 
# 1. Define the agents' tools to access the web and write files
# 2. Define some utilities to help create the graph and agents
# 3. Create and define each team (web research + doc writing)
# 4. Compose everything together.
# 
# ## Setup
# 
# First, let's install our required packages and set our API keys

# 
# The research team can use a search engine and url scraper to find information on the web. Feel free to add additional functionality below to boost the team performance!
